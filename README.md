### If you're curious to know something more about me here's my story...
My father says I do things that go online.

Despite the old computer of my parents being a testament to my great passion for design and all things digital from a young ageâ€”filled to the last byte with PowerPoint files packed with flags and logos reproduced using the geometric drawing tools available in the softwareâ€”my post-high school career took a turn when I enrolled in the Civil Engineering program at the University of Genoa.

However, a few exams short of earning my degree, I decided to put my university career on hold and return to my never-fading love for design: I then opened a VAT number and decided to become a freelance graphic designer.

Over the years, this led me to collaborate with some digital agencies in the Genoa area and to contribute to the founding of the university-targeted startup **[Youni.life]("https://youni.life/")**.

Following clients' requests and my curiosity in learning new things, over time my specialty shifted from <**illustration** to **web design**, moving through **brand design** and **3D modeling**.

Intrigued by how an interface I designed could work, I realized that making mockups was no longer enough for me, so I delved into web development and learned the main programming languages and frameworks used in the field. Currently, I get paid to design colorful buttons and write magic formulas on a black screen to make interacting with those buttons as engaging as possible.

As my father says: *I do things that go online*.
